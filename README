# PoC Krazo Asset Controller

This repository contains a proof of concept which shows how a static asset controller can be used
to serve Jakarta MVC applications on the context root without the problem of not loading assets
served by the servlet container.

The problem which led to this PoC is the fact, that a Jakarta MVC application can't run on context root
and use static assets provided by the servlet container at the same time. The reason for this is, that
the servlet container itself wants to provide those assets on it's context root, but this is already
in use by Jakarta RESTful Web Services / Jakarta MVC. By providing an opt-in controller for those use-cases,
implementing plain Jakarta MVC applications would be a lot more comfortable.

## Starting the PoC

- With Tomcat 10: `mvn clean package org.codehaus.cargo:cargo-maven3-plugin:run -Ptomcat`
- With GlassFish 6: `mvn clean package org.codehaus.cargo:cargo-maven3-plugin:run -Pglassfish6`
- With GlassFish 7 Nightly: `mvn clean package org.codehaus.cargo:cargo-maven3-plugin:run -Pglassfish7`
- With WildFly 26: `mvn -Pwildfly package wildfly-jar:package wildfly-jar:run`
